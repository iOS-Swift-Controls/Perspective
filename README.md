## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 10.0+
- Swift 5+

## Usage

### Basics

Create a `PerspectiveView`:

```swift
import Perspective

let perspectiveView = PerspectiveView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))

view.addSubview(perspectiveView)
```

Configure its `contentSize`:

```swift
perspectiveView.contentSize = CGSize(width: 1599, height: 900)
```

Add the images as arranged subviews:

```swift
for i in stride(from: 7, to: 0, by: -1) {
  let imgView = UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: "castle-layer0\(i)"))
  imgView.frame.size = CGSize(width: 1599, height: 900)

  perspectiveView.addArrangedSubview(imgView)
}
```

### Behaviours

A behaviour is an object that allows you to interact with the perspective view. If you want to let your users to scroll the persective you can add a `PerspectiveScrollBehaviour`, and if you want to use the accelerometer just add a `PerspectiveMotionBehaviour`. To add a new behaviour to your perspective view you must call the `addBehaviour` method.

#### Scroll

```swift
perspectiveView.addBehaviour(PerspectiveScrollBehaviour())
```

#### Motion

```swift
perspectiveView.addBehaviour(PerspectiveMotionBehaviour())
```

### How it works

![Layers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/798235/51544126-7a0e6180-1e5f-11e9-8071-a53271c99431.png)

1. the `PerspectiveView`'s `frame` rectangle: describes the view’s location and size in its superview’s coordinate system like any another `UIView`.
2. the `PerspectiveView`'s `contentSize`: defines the extent of the content (usually `UIImageView`).
3. the `arrangedSubviews`: list the views arranged by the perspective view. The order of the views work like in any `UIView`. The foreground view is at the end of the array (as opposite to the background which is the first element of the array).

### Configuration

If you use the motion behaviour, configure the `UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities` key of its *Info.plist* file with the `accelerometer` and `gyroscope` values:

## Installation

The recommended approach to use *Perspective* in your project is using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

#### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your *Podfile* and add _Perspective_:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '11.0'

use_frameworks!
pod 'Perspective', '~> 0.9.1'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file):

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

You can now `import Perspective` framework into your files.

#### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate `Perspective` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile` file:

```ogdl
github "yannickl/Perspective" >= 0.9.1
```

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/yannickl/Perspective/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `Perspective` folder into your project to use it in.
